This project utilizes Kaggle's dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/google-stock-price for 
recurrent neural network training purpose.

In Training RNN, we compare various measures (i.e., exisiting formulas in stock trading but validate by 
recurrent neural network through training) to find the best
combination of method in predicting the stock market.
